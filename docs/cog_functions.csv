"FE Men and women with extraverted Feeling functions base their decisions on their values, which are determined through their interactions with other people and their assessments of others’ needs. Their value systems are heavily influenced by cultural and societal norms, which reveals the outward focus of their feeling function. People in this category are sensitive and empathic and will go to great lengths to help other people in any way they can.",Fe,
"FI Individuals who possess introverted Feeling as a cognitive function are the most empathetic of all types. They can feel others’ pain and unhappiness as if it were their own, and they will act to relieve that pain and unhappiness if they can. Their value systems mean everything to them, and they adopt their ethics based on their own assessments rather than the opinions of others. They will do what seems right to them, regardless of prevailing cultural or societal standards.",Fi,
"TE Of all the cognitive functions, extraverted Thinking is most closely associated with the relentless use of logic and reason. Emotions are set aside, and judgments are made entirely based on what seems reasonable and rational. People with extraverted thinking functions know how to compartmentalize their emotions as they make their decisions, so they don’t distort the thinking process. They are verbally adept and highly persuasive, showing the capacity to create tightly structured arguments that impress most listeners.",Te,
"TI Those who have an introverted Thinking function are deeply analytical and logical. Their frames of reference come from their internally held belief systems, which are carefully constructed based on past insights and discoveries. They expect reality to conform to their already existing ideas, although if there are persistent conflicts they will adjust their thinking gradually over time. They reflect on everything happening around them and are reluctant to let anything go until they’re sure they understand.",Ti,
"NI Those who possess introverted Intuition rely on their instincts to guide them through life. If you ask them to explain their conclusions or behavior, they often wouldn’t be able to do so logically or rationally. They are the go-with-the-flow type, content to let their subconscious minds steer them in the proper direction. They are focused inward, exploring their own minds for guidance, and very much oriented toward the future rather than the immediate moment.",Ni,
"NE People with extraverted Intuition see patterns everywhere. They notice connections between things, people, and events that others miss. Their intellects are speculative and creative, and they’re always trying to come up with new and more inclusive ideas that capture reality more fully and comprehensively. Individuals with extraverted intuition are excellent speakers and communicators who know how to carry others along with them on their imaginative excursions.",Ne,
"SE People with the extraverted Sensing function rely on their five senses to absorb as much information about their environment as they can. They are highly observant and sensitive, and notice details about what is happening around them that other people miss. They tend to be very focused on the here-and-now, preferring to live in the moment rather than thinking about what might happen next week, next month, or next year.",Se,
"SI Those who have an introverted Sensing function relate past experiences to present circumstances. Sensory input (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste) is used as a frame of reference to build ideas about how the world is and how it works, which leads to strongly patterned ways of acting and responding. Men and women with an introverted sensing function are highly organized, thrive on routine, and have wonderful memories.",Si,
